## Project Description
The *Library Fine Management* system is a database-driven project designed to manage book loans, returns, and fine calculations efficiently. The system automates fine management, ensures accurate tracking of overdue returns, and provides detailed insights into fine collection statistics.

The system leverages *SQL* and *PL/SQL* to handle complex database operations, ensuring data integrity and consistency across all transactions.

## Features
- *Book Loans and Returns Management*:  
  - Tracks the issuance and return of books.
  - Automatically calculates overdue status for returns.
- *Fine Calculation*:  
  - Implements triggers to calculate fines for overdue returns.
  - PL/SQL functions to waive fines under specific conditions.
- *Fine Collection Reporting*:  
  - Generates daily and monthly reports of fine collections for monitoring and analysis.

---

## Technologies Used
- *SQL* (Structured Query Language)  
  - For database querying and management.
- *PL/SQL* (Procedural Language/SQL)  
  - For stored procedures, triggers, and complex calculations.

## Key Database Tasks
1. *Fine Calculation for Overdue Returns*:  
   - Triggers to automatically calculate fines based on the number of overdue days.
2. *Fine Waiving Under Specific Conditions*:  
   - PL/SQL functions to waive fines for special cases, such as library closures or other valid reasons.
3. *Generate Fine Collection Reports*:  
   - SQL queries to produce daily and monthly reports of fine collections.

## How to Run the System
1. Set up an Oracle Database with the required schema and tables.
2. Load the provided SQL scripts for creating triggers, functions, and stored procedures.
3. Use a SQL client to interact with the database for managing book loans, returns, and fine calculations.
4. Execute queries and test system functionalities as per project requirements.
